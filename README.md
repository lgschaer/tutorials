# Tutorials for 16S rRNA Sequence Analysis 


## Run DADA2 first!

See tutorial here: https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html


## Making a phyloseq object

This tutorial shows you how to make a phyloseq object from the ouput files from DADA2. Requires phyloseq and tidyverse to be installed. Link to tutorial: 


## Alpha Diversity

This tutorial shows you how to compare alpha diversity of different sample groups. Make boxplots to visualize differences. Run Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn (post-hoc) tests to test for statistically significant differences. Requires phyloseq, tidyverse, and FSA to be installed.

## Beta Diversity

This tutorial shows you how to compare alpha diversity of different sample groups. Requires phyloseq, tidyverse, and ape to be installed. Link to tutorial: 


## Making a taxa plot

This tutorial shows you how to make a stacked bar chart from a phyloseq object. Requires phyloseq and tidyverse to be installed. Link to tutorial: https://rpubs.com/lgschaerer/1006964
